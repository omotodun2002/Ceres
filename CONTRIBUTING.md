## Releasing

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions. To create a new release:

1. Update version in `Cargo.toml`:
   ```toml
   [workspace.package]
   version = "X.Y.Z"
   ```

2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`:
   - Move items from `[Unreleased]` to new version section
   - Add date: `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`

3. Commit changes:
   ```bash
   git add Cargo.toml CHANGELOG.md
   git commit -m "chore: prepare release vX.Y.Z"
   git push
   ```

4. Create and push tag:
   ```bash
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

5. Monitor the [Actions tab](https://github.com/AndreaBozzo/Ceres/actions) for the release workflow.

### Version Format

Only stable versions are supported: `vX.Y.Z` (e.g., v0.1.0, v1.0.0).
